# How to build and run
* Place the `hotels` or `hotels-small` dataset in the /build/ directory. From terminal cd into /build/ and type:
* `make`
* `./main`

Part 2 of the project can be found in `Part02-Complexity.md`

If for whatever reason the Makefile provided does not work and you have CMake installed, you can generate a working Makefile by:
* `cd build`
* `cmake ../`
* `make`
* `./main`
